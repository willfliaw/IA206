# Neuro-Symbolic AI (IA206) - 2023/2024

## Course Overview

This repository contains materials and resources for the course **Neuro-Symbolic AI (IA206)**, part of the **Data & Artificial Intelligence** curriculum. The course explores the intersection of symbolic and statistical approaches in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students will learn to combine traditional symbolic methods like logic and knowledge representation with modern machine learning techniques, particularly neural networks.

### Key Topics:

- Prolog: A declarative programming language tailored for symbolic AI tasks such as knowledge management, natural language processing, and reasoning.
- ProbLog: An extension of Prolog that integrates probabilistic reasoning and neural networks, allowing for data-efficient, interpretable AI.
- Formal Logic: Propositional and predicate logic, proofs, and refutations.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Techniques such as Definite Clause Grammars (DCG) and unification-based parsing.
- Symbolic Machine Learning: Inductive learning and complexity minimization.
- Knowledge Representation: Description logics, ontologies, and the Semantic Web.
- Probabilistic Programming: ProbLog and decision diagrams.

## Prerequisites

Students are expected to have a basic understanding of:
- Formal logic
- General AI concepts
- Basic programming skills (Prolog knowledge is a plus but not required)

## Course Structure

- Total Hours: 24 hours (16 sessions)
- Credits: 2.5 ECTS
- Evaluation: Practical assignments and knowledge tests.

## Instructor

- Professor Nils Holzenberger

## Installation and Setup

Some exercises and projects require installing SWI-Prolog and ProbLog. You can follow the instructions below to set up your environment:

1. SWI-Prolog:
   Download and install SWI-Prolog from [SWI-Prolog Official Site](https://www.swi-prolog.org/).
2. ProbLog:
   You can clone the official repository of ProbLog from [ProbLog GitHub](https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/problog). Follow the installation instructions in the README of the ProbLog repository.

## How to Contribute
