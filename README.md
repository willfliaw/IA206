# IA206 - Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence

## Course Overview

This repository contains the materials and code for the course IA206 - Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence, taught by Professor Nils Holzenberger during S2-P3 of the 2023-2024 academic year at Télécom Paris. The course focuses on the integration of symbolic and statistical approaches in Artificial Intelligence (AI), beginning with the fundamentals of programming in Prolog and leading to more advanced topics like ProbLog, a framework that combines symbolic reasoning with neural networks.

## Topics Covered

1. Prolog and ProbLog: Declarative programming for symbolic AI.
2. Formal Logic: Propositions, predicates, proof by refutation.
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP): DCG, parsing, and unification in Prolog.
4. Symbolic Machine Learning: Concepts of symbolic induction and complexity minimization.
5. Knowledge Representation: Logics, ontologies, and Semantic Web technologies.
6. Probabilistic Programming: Use of probabilistic logic and decision diagrams.

## Course Schedule

- Period: S2-P3 (12/02/2024 - 24/04/2024)
- Language: English

## Installation and Setup

Some exercises and projects require installing SWI-Prolog and ProbLog. You can follow the instructions below to set up your environment:

1. SWI-Prolog:
   Download and install SWI-Prolog from [SWI-Prolog Official Site](https://www.swi-prolog.org/).
2. ProbLog:
   You can clone the official repository of ProbLog from [ProbLog GitHub](https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/problog). Follow the installation instructions in the README of the ProbLog repository.
